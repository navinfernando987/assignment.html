They are adapted to an arboreal lifestyle (a life among trees), which is assisted by skeletal specialisations such as highly mobile joints, large humerus, strong bones, equally long fore and hind limbs with super strong digits, and anatomical modifications such as a shortened tip of the ulna to the dimensions of a styloid process."
