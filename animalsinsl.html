                        <p id="animalsinslp1">Sri Lanka, a biodiversity hotspot, is home to a variety of unique and fascinating animals. The Sri Lankan elephant, Elephas maximus maximus, is an iconic species found throughout the island's national parks and forests. These gentle giants, revered in Sri Lankan culture, face threats from habitat loss and human-wildlife conflict, making conservation efforts essential for their survival.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p id="animalsinslp2">One of the island's elusive residents is the Sri Lankan leopard, Panthera pardus kotiya. Endemic to Sri Lanka, these big cats are known for their distinctive golden coat adorned with dark rosettes. Yala National Park serves as a prime location for spotting these leopards in their natural habitat, though they are endangered due to habitat fragmentation and poaching, emphasizing the importance of conservation measures.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p id="animalsinslp3">Among Sri Lanka's avian wonders is the Sri Lanka blue magpie, Urocissa ornata. This endemic bird boasts a stunning blue plumage and long tail feathers, and it can be found in the central and southern hills of the island. Conservation initiatives focus on preserving the diverse ecosystems that support Sri Lanka's birdlife, addressing threats such as habitat destruction and climate change to ensure the continued vibrancy of these feathered inhabitants.</p>
